<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We are excited to run a new programme, MSc Applied Developmental Psychology.  At the centre of the programme are young people, their families, and the community. It has several unique features including a weekly Community of Practice bringing interdisciplinary researchers, policymakers, and practitioners together. Students gain a first-hand understanding of the translational nature of developmental science to some of the main challenges for young people and their families today. There is also an opportunity for a placement with a partner organisation to gain experience in psychological interventions.</p>
<p>The curriculum for the <strong>Developmental Science, Practice and Policy Module</strong> is divided into three main themes; <ul><li>literacy and language</li> <li>relationships and belonging</li> <li>life chances and equality</li></ul>
<p>The <strong>Psychology Placement Module</strong> includes a preparation phase, the placement itself, and then opportunities for interpreting and reflecting on the placement experience.</p>  
<p>The <strong>Advanced Research Design and Analysis</strong> curriculum includes training in the use of R for different research designs and statistical techniques (e.g., ANOVA, structural equation modelling); and qualitative methods will involve opportunities to understand more about visual ethnography and photo elicitation.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Dissertation</strong> takes students further into the forefront of psychology today, with Open Science and co-design with stakeholders.  All of which we believe will more than prepare students for careers in research and professional psychology.</p>
<p>We have created repository sections for our students to make publicly available to fellow researchers, practitioners, policy-makers, and stakeholders summary reports based on the evidence they have accumulated through the communities of practice for literacy and language, relationships and belonging, life chances and equality to support case studies for psychological interventions.
<br>
Please take time to look through them as they are updated during the year.
